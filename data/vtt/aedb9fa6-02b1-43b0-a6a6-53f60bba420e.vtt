"RIDE" letters fade into a black screen

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Panning of Lana Del Rey swinging from a tire swing with her hair blowing

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
I was in the winter of my life. And the men I met along the road were my only summer.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.000
At night I fell asleep with visions of myself dancing and laughing and crying with them.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Three years down the line of being on an endless world tour and my memories of them were the only things that sustained me. And my only real happy times. 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:15.000
I was a singer, not a very popular one. I once had dreams of becoming a beautiful poet.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:41.000
But, upon an unfortunate series of events, saw those dreams dashed and divided like a million stars in the night sky. That I wished on over and over again, sparkling and broken. But I didn't really mind because I knew that it takes getting everything you ever wanted and then losing it to know what true freedom is.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:02:08.000
When the people I used to know found out what I had been doing, how I had been living, they asked me why, but there's no use in talking to people who have a home. They have no idea what it's like to seek safety in other people. For home to be wherever you lie your head. 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:33.000
I was always an unusual girl. My mother told me that I had a chameleon soul. No moral compass pointing due north. No fixed personality. Just an inner indecisiveness that was as wide and wavering as the ocean. 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.000
And if I said I didn't plan for it to turn out this way I'd be lying.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:59.000
Because I was born to be the other woman. Who belonged to no one. Who belonged to everyone. Who had nothing. Who wanted everything.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:15.000
With a fire for every experience and an obession for freedom that terrified me to the point that I couldn't even talk about it. And pushed me to a nomadic point of madness that both dazzled and dizzied me. 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:45.000
[Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh]

00:03:46.000 --> 00:04:00.000
I've been out on that open road. But you can be my full-time daddy, white and gold.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:19.000
Singing blues has been gettin' old. But you can be my full-time baby, hot or cold. 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:41.000
Don't break me down (don't break me down), I've been traveling too long (I been traveling too long), I been tryin' too hard (I been tryin' too hard), With one pretty song (with one pretty song)

00:04:43.000 --> 00:05:00.000
I hear the birds on the summer breeze, I drive fast. I am alone at midnight. Been trying hard not to get into trouble, but I-I've got a war in my mind.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:22.000
So, I just ride, just ride. I just ride, I just ride.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:55.000
Dying young and playing hard. That's the way my father made his life and art. Drink all day and we talk 'til dark. That's the way the road dogs do it, light 'til dark

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:17.000
Don't leave me now (don't leave me now), Don't say goodbye (don't say goodbye), Don't turn around (don't turn around), Leave me high and dry (leave me high and dry)

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:38.000
I hear the birds on the summer breeze, I drive fast. I am alone at midnight. Been trying hard not to get into trouble, but I-I've got a war in my mind.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:59.000
I just ride, just ride. I just ride, I just ride.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:21.000
I'm tired of feeling like I'm fucking crazy. I'm tired of driving 'til I see stars in my eyes. It's all I've got to keep myself sane, baby. So I just ride, I just ride.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:39.000
I hear the birds on the summer breeze, I drive fast. I am alone at midnight. Been trying hard not to get into trouble, but I-I've got a war in my mind.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:08:01.000
I just ride, just ride. I just ride, I just ride.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:36.000
Every night I used to pray that I'd find my people. And finally I did. On the open road, we had nothing to lose, nothing to gain, nothing we desired anymore 

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
Except to make our lives into a work of art. 

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:50.000
Live fast. Die young. Be wild. And have fun.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:09:09.000
I believe in the country American used to be. I believe in the person I want to become. I believe in the freedom of the open road. And my motto is the same as ever, "I believe in the kindness of strangers"

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:17.000
And when I'm at war with myself, I ride. I just ride. 

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:30.000
Who are you? Are you in touch with all of your darkest fantasies? Have you created a life for yourself where you can experience them?
